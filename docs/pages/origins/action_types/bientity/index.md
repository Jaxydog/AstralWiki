[Bi-entity Action Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/bientity_action_types/) operate on entities, or rather *pairs* of entities.

These actions operate on two entities: an actor and a target.
Which entity is which is entirely dependent on the used [Power Type](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/power_types/), and can be swapped using [Invert](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/bientity_action_types/invert/).

Some (more specific) actions can only be applied to certain entity types.
For example, the [Set In Love](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/bientity_action_types/set_in_love/) action may only be applied to animals that can breed.

These are available to any [Power Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/power_types/) or [Action Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/action_types/) that require a [Bi-entity Action](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/bientity_action_types/) field.
