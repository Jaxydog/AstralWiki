[Entity Action Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/entity_action_types/) operate on entities.

Some (more specific) actions can only be applied to certain entity types.
For example, the [Crafting Table](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/entity_action_types/crafting_table/) action may only be applied to players, as they are the only entities capable of interacting with a GUI.

These are available to any [Power Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/power_types/) or [Action Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/action_types/) that require an [Entity Action](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/entity_action_types/) field.
