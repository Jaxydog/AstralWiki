[Bi-entity Condition Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/bientity_condition_types/) operate on entities, or rather *pairs* of entities.

These conditions operate on two entities: an actor and a target.
Which entity is which is entirely dependent on the used [Power Type](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/power_types/), and can be swapped using [Invert](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/bientity_condition_types/invert/).

Some (more specific) conditions can only be applied to certain entity types.
For example, the [Owner](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/bientity_condition_types/owner/) condition may only be applied to animals that can be tamed.

These are available to any [Power Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/power_types/) or [Condition Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/condition_types/) that require a [Bi-entity Condition](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/bientity_condition_types/) field.
