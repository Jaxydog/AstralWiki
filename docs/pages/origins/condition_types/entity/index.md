[Entity Condition Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/entity_condition_types/) operate on entities.

Some (more specific) conditions can only be applied to certain entity types.
For example, the [Swimming](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/entity_condition_types/swimming/) condition may only be applied to players, as they are the only entities capable of swimming.

These are available to any [Power Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/power_types/) or [Condition Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/condition_types/) that require an [Entity Condition](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/types/entity_condition_types/) field.
